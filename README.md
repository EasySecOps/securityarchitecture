# securityarchitecture

Microsoft security products offer great functionality and value, and are considered best-in-class by many standards, It covers the breadth of enterprise security needs and provide deep level of security across all domains.

This high level article is meant to help understand how the different solutions in M365 and Azure security stack fit together.

Based on the customer conversations and and implementation of Microsoft security offerings, I have put together a High Level Cybersecurity Architecture available at the below link.

Naming convention
If you found some of our solution names a bit hard to follow in the past, your definitely weren't alone. All that is set to change, with the recent rename of our cybersecurity solutions in an attempt to simplify the naming scheme and classify under common broader nomenclature. With recent rename, these products also follow a simpler naming scheme. Here are the key principles to keep in mind:
- All security solutions fall under Defender umbrella with 'Defender for <workload>' naming convention (For instance, Defender for Identity, Defender for Endpoints and so on).
- Everything integrates with everything. We believe the power of automatic correlation and investigation provides the best value to SecOps teams and helps free their time to focus on things that matter. It's very much there, remaining pieces will fall into place gradually.
- Everything will roll into Sentinel - out cloud-native SIEM.
